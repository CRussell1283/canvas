This script is designed to bulk-modify the Visibility setting of multiple courses in Canvas.

Steps:
1.
  Users of this script should navigate to the Settings page of the account/sub-account containing the courses being targeted for visibility changes.
2.
  a. From there, run a Provisioning Report (for Courses) to get a CSV containing the intended course IDs.  No additional changes to this CSV will be required so long as it only contains data for courses intended to have their visibility adjusted. Otherwise, remove any lines with extraneous course data from the CSV.
  b. Alternatively, a CSV can be generated by hand with one header, "canvas_course_id" (without quotations). Include the numeric course IDs (which appear in a course's URL) for each pertinent course in the column below that header.
3.
  Once a CSV has been generated, simply fill in the blanks indicated in the script file with the proper data, then run the script; it should take a second or so for each course that needs an update.

Note: This script uses the Typhoeus gem, which it requires in order to run (https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus)
