# Change SIS ID
The following Ruby & Python scripts can be used to update SIS ID's from a CSV.

# Setup

When creating the CSV file, you will need to make a column named `old_user_sis_id` as one header.
The other header needs to be `new_user_sis_id` for the value you want it changed to.

You can see the sample CSV file `example.csv` for format of CSV file.
